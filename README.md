# socket_programming

This is a mini project for academic purpose. It consists of several client server programs. The programs include:
- Detecting whether the given string is **palindrome** or not.
- **Returning the datatype** of client input.
- Encryption and decption of client's message at server side in **Rail Fence Cipher**.
- Encryption and decption of client's message at server side in **Vigen√®re Cipher**.
- Encryption and decption of client's message at server side in **Substitution Cipher**.
